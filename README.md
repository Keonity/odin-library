A small library web app to demonstrate CRUD interaction with JS objects and rendering them in HTML. 

Books are stored as objects with the following properties: title, author, and read status. The user is able to create new books and add them to the database as well as delete books and change their read status. 

The database is local and volatile, refreshing itself upon page reload and not saving any data.
